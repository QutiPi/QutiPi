## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Jumpnow Technologies, LLC for their cracking [tutorial](http://www.jumpnowtek.com/rpi/Raspberry-Pi-Systems-with-Yocto.html) that got me (Sam) started with Yocto. Alot of the recipes used in this repo are copies from their recipes in [meta-rpi](https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi) layer, check it out!

Another shout out to Lirios for their [meta-liri](https://github.com/lirios/meta-liri); their [Fluid](https://github.com/lirios/fluid) framework is also worth a look.
